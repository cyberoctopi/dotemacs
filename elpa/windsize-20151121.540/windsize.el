;; Package-Version: 20151121.540
;; Version: 0.1
;; Keywords: window, resizing, convenience

;; This file is not part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;; Use the arrow keys (C-S-<dir> by default) to move one of the
;; borders of the active window in that direction. Always prefers to
;; move the right or bottom border when possible, and falls back to
;; moving the left or top border otherwise.
;; 
;; Rather than me trying to explain that in detail, it's best to just
;; split your emacs frame in to several windows and try it - trust me,
;; it's intuitive once you give it a go.

;;; Usage

;; (require 'windsize)
;; (windsize-default-keybindings) ; C-S-<left/right/up/down>
;;
;; Or bind windsize-left, windsize-right, windsize-up, and
;; windsize-down to the keys you prefer.
;;
;; By default, resizes by 8 columns and by 4 rows. Customize by
;; setting windsize-cols and/or windsize-rows.
;; Note that these variables are not buffer-local, since resizing
;; windows usually affects at least 2 buffers.
